Tengwar Unicode keyboard layout (based on US-Dvorak)

This layout is part of the Free Tengwar Font Project. For more
information, see http://freetengwar.sourceforge.net/


INSTALLATION


chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh


If successful, the script will also generate an uninstall script.

If you prefer to install manually, first move tengdvorak to
"the right place". Where this is depends on your Linux version.
The following works for the latest versions of Ubuntu:


sudo cp tengdvorak /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/


Then edit "the right file". Again, on the latest version of Ubuntu,
this is /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml, but your system
may be configured differently. When you have found the file, add
the following code just before "</layoutList>"


    <layout>
      <configItem>
        <name>tengdvorak</name>
        <shortDescription>Tengwar</shortDescription>
        <description>Tengwar Unicode Dvorak</description>
        <languageList><iso639Id>qya</iso639Id></languageList>
      </configItem>
      <variantList/>
    </layout>


After a successfull installation, you will have to enable the
keyboard layout. If you are using GNOME, you may find this option
under System, Preferences, Keyboard, Layouts. When sorting layouts
by language, you will find the Tengwar layout under Artificial
languages. You will probably also want to add the Keyboard Indicator
panel to your system bar, to easily see what layout is active.
